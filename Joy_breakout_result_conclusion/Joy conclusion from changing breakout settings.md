##Joy breakout code conclusion:


### For each output result:

1. Increasing Episode Length and Reward: There is a clear trend of increasing episode length and reward, suggesting that the agent is learning to play the game more effectively and is able to survive longer in the game environment.
2. Decrease in Exploration Rate: The exploration rate gradually decreases, which is expected as the training progresses. This decrease allows the agent to shift from exploring the environment to exploiting the learned policies.

### exploration_fraction=0.3, exploration_final_eps=0.1 vs. exploration_fraction=0.5, exploration_final_eps=0.05:

1. The final average reward is higher when we increase the exploration fraction. But at lower exploration fraction, it reaches a higher reward faster (13.9 at time step 232,332, vs. 9.01 at time step 208,761).

2. Allowing the agent more time to explore (higher exploration_fraction) generally leads to a more thorough understanding of the environment, which can be beneficial in complex environments where the initial random policy might not perform well. However, it also means that learning and performance improvements might be observed more slowly.

3. Balancing Exploration and Exploitation: Too much exploration can lead to worse performance as the agent might not exploit the best-known strategies effectively. Conversely, too little exploration can prevent the agent from discovering potentially better strategies.
